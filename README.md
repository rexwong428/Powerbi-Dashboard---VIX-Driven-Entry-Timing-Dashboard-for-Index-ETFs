**VIX-Driven Entry Timing Dashboard for Index ETFs**

This Power BI dashboard is designed to identify potential entry opportunities for major index ETFs (such as SPY, QQQ, SSO, TQQQ, and UPRO) based on spikes in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). By analyzing historical data, it highlights moments when the VIX crosses a user-defined threshold (default: 40), which often signals market dips driven by heightened fear and volatility. These points have historically led to strong long-term returns as markets recover, making it a useful tool for timing entries in volatile environments.
Key Features:

Entry Signal Detection: Tracks VIX levels above the threshold to pinpoint buy opportunities, displaying entry dates, holding periods, stock returns, and maximum drawdowns.
Visualizations: Includes charts for VIX trends, cumulative ETF returns, and drawdown analysis over selected periods.
Adjustability: Users can customize the VIX threshold and chart date range to explore different time periods or sensitivity levels, enabling backtesting and scenario analysis.
Data Insights: Reveals the rarity of high-VIX signals (e.g., clustered during crises like 2020), amplified returns from leveraged ETFs, and the need for risk tolerance due to significant drawdowns.
